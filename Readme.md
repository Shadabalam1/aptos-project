# MembershipSystem Smart Contract

## Vision

The **MembershipSystem** smart contract provides a decentralized solution for managing memberships on-chain. It allows users to purchase memberships using tokens, and providers can define membership periods and renewals. This system enhances user access to services while ensuring transparent management of membership status.

## Features

- **Purchase Membership**:
  - Users can purchase a membership by paying tokens, with an option for multiple renewals.
- **Check Membership Status**:
  - The contract allows users or services to verify if a membership is still active and how many renewals remain.

## Future Scope

1. **Automatic Renewal**:
   - Implement automatic membership renewals based on predefined intervals.
2. **Upgradable Membership Plans**:
   - Allow providers to offer different tiers of memberships with varying benefits.
3. **Discounts and Incentives**:
   - Introduce discounts or bonus renewals for long-term users or bulk membership purchases.

The **MembershipSystem** aims to simplify and decentralize membership management, providing a transparent and efficient process for both users and service providers.
